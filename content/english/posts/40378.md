## Introduction

Collectors of LEGO® BrickHeadz™ will love Goofy & Pluto (40378), featuring 2 classic Disney characters. Goofy, wearing his familiar turtleneck sweater and tall green hat, stands alongside the playful Pluto. The 2 lovable Disney friends come with sturdy baseplates that make them easy to display, either individually or alongside other BrickHeadz models. Collectors of LEGO BrickHeadz can combine elements of different sets to create fun, mashed-up characters of their own.

A great gift for LEGO® and Disney fans, this set provides an age-appropriate build-and-play experience for kids aged 10 and up.
With Goofy standing over 3” (8cm) tall and Pluto over 1” (5cm) tall, this 214-piece buildable toy delivers creative fun on a big scale as kids build, play and display.
